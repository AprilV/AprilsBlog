      <p>Hi, my name is <strong>April V. Sykes</strong>, and this blog is part of my work for <strong>IS390 IS Reading and Research</strong>.</p>
      <p>Over the next 10 weeks, I’ll be researching and reflecting on the topic <em>“The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence: From Science Fiction to Reality.”</em></p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this blog is to track my progress, document key insights,
        and connect what I’m learning to both historical context and current technology.
        Each post will focus on a specific part of the topic.
      </p>
      <p>By the end, this blog will show the full path of my research and what I’ve learned along the way.</p>
