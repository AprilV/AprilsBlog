        <h1>AI Research Paper</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is <strong>April V. Sykes</strong>. I’m currently taking <strong>IS390 IS Reading and Research</strong>, and this blog is part of my coursework.</p>
        <p>I’m interested in how technology evolves and how ideas that once seemed like science fiction eventually become reality. That’s why I chose to research <em>“The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence: From Science Fiction to Reality.”</em></p>
        <p>This blog will follow my 10-week research process. I’ll be using it to document my thoughts, research progress, and personal reflections as I explore how AI has developed over time and where it might be going.</p>
        <p>By the end, this will serve as a record of what I’ve learned—and how my thinking has grown throughout the project.</p>
