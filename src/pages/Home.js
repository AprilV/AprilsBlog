            Hello and welcome to my corner of the web! I'm <strong>April V. Sykes</strong>, a tech-driven learner and problem-solver based in <strong>Bremerton, Washington</strong>. I’m currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Network Administration (AAS-T) and Information Services (BASIS)</strong> at <strong>Olympic College</strong>, where I’ve been immersed in hands-on learning and real-world application since 2023.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at Olympic College, I’ve worked as an <strong>IT Technician,</strong>providing frontline support for campus systems and contributing to a strong and reliable technology environment. I've also earned a place on the <strong>President’s Scholars List</strong> and joined the <strong>Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society</strong> thanks to a 3.93 GPA and consistent academic excellence.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for IT isn’t new. I previously held key roles at <strong>Dell Technologies</strong> and <strong>Wipro</strong>, where I led teams and managed large-scale infrastructure, disaster recovery, and data center operations. I also spent a decade supporting systems at <strong>Jewish Hospital & St. Mary's HealthCare</strong>, earning the <em>Ambassador Award</em> for outstanding performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of corporate IT, I ran a customer-facing jewelry business at <strong>Be Dazzled Beads - Land of Odds</strong>, helping clients design, repair, and personalize wearable art. That experience sharpened my ability to listen, adapt, and create skills I now apply in tech with equal passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also certified in multiple areas, including <strong>Certified Network Professional (CNP)</strong>, <strong>Certified Client Pro</strong>, <strong>PC Pro</strong>, <strong>Security Pro</strong>, and <strong>TestOut Linux Pro</strong>. These certifications reflect my dedication to staying sharp in a fast-evolving field.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is where I’ll showcase my work, reflect on my learning, and connect with others who are just as curious about the tech world as I am. Whether you're here for collaboration, inspiration, or a shared interest in how technology shapes our future. Thank You for visiting.
